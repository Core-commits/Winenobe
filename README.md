0. If you haven't installed the dependencies above, go do it right now !
1. Download and extract the latest source code from the [releases page](https://github.com/LeadRDRK/Winenobe/releases)
- Alternatively, you may clone or download the repository. Please be aware that the version on the repo is bleeding edge and might be broken. Don't do this unless you know what you're doing.
2. Open up a terminal emulator. Change the directory to the one that you just downloaded.
3. Run `chmod +x winenobe.sh`
4. Depending on the version you wanted to install, run the following commands:
- `./winenobe.sh 2016` for 2016
- `./winenobe.sh 2012` for 2012
- Run `./winenobe.sh --help` to display additional options.
- Disclaimer: Although this script allows installation of the 2012 version, as of the current Wine development version (4.15), it does not work yet. Blame Wine.
